        BIO
        I am Andrew Olenovych. I was born 27 November 1997 in Uman and lived there about 17 years.
        In 2005 I went to secondary school № 2. Uman,  which I graduated in 2015.
        That time was the best in my life. Then I met many friends and familiars.
        In 2015, I entered the Kyiv National Economic University, Department of International Economics and management.
